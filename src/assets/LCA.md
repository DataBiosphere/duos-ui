Broad Data Use Oversight System (DUOS) – LIBRARY CARD AGREEMENT 


1. ***Introduction***. The Broad Institute, Inc. (“Broad”) seeks to improve human health by using genomics to advance the understanding of human disease. The production, storage, access management and analysis of genomic data is a key aspect of this mission. Broad manages access to certain of this genomic data via its Data Use Oversight System (“***DUOS***”). By executing and delivering this Library Card Agreement (this “***Agreement***”), Broad agrees to grant access to and use of certain genomic data to the undersigned requesting institution (the “***Requestor***”) on the terms and conditions contained herein; and the Requestor hereby agrees to such terms and conditions. The effective date of this Agreement will be the date this Agreement is fully executed by Requestor and Broad.\
\
See Section 21 below for the meanings of certain terms that are not otherwise defined in the text of this Agreement.\
\
The Requestor will enter this Agreement once, and multiple approvals of this Agreement will not be required for each Library Card Holder so long as this Agreement is in effect. An Institutional Signing Official will be required to execute this Agreement on behalf of the Requestor.


2. ***Library Card Program***. From time to time during the term of this Agreement, the Requestor may issue one or more Library Cards to specific Requestor Investigators for the purpose of accessing and using certain Data (details of which will be set out in the applicable DAR) managed by DUOS. Broad expects (and the Requestor acknowledges and agrees) that Authorized Users of Data recognize any restrictions on such Data use established by Broad and/or the applicable Data Providers as specified in the information provided in connection with such Data. New uses of the Data outside those described in the DAR will require submission of a new DAR. Subject to the provisions of Section 18 of this Agreement, access to any requested Data is granted for a period of one (1) year, with the option to renew access and use beyond such one (1) year period or close-out a Project prior to or at the end of such one (1) year period.


3. ***Issuance of a Library Card***. The Requestor agrees that to approve Library Card access to a Requestor Investigator, then such Requestor Investigator will be issued a Library Card Holder via the Requestor’s Signing Official interface in DUOS. Once a Requestor Investigator has been approved as a Library Card Holder, and so long as such Library Card is in effect, such Requestor Investigator may make DARs for Data managed by DUOS. A Library Card issued to a particular Library Card Holder also covers access to and use of the specified Data by any person at the same Requestor who reports to the Library Card Holder and by the Internal Collaborators of the Library Card Holder who are employees of Requestor and listed as Internal Collaborators on the specific DAR for access and use of such Data. If a Library Card Holder plans to collaborate with individuals not at the Requestor, the individuals at each such external site must submit an independent DAR. If such a collaborator is not also a Library Card Holder, then such investigator’s DAR will also require such investigator’s Institutional Signing Official’s approval, using the same project title and research use statement. Library Card Holders may be required to have IRB approval if they have access to personal identifying information for Research Participants. The Requestor hereby assures Broad that, when issuing a Requestor Investigator a Library Card, other institutional departments at the Requestor with relevant authorities (e.g., those overseeing human subjects research, information technology, technology transfer) have also approved such issuance of a Library Card to such Requestor Investigator. Library Cards are not transferable.\
\
The Requestor agrees that if a Library Card Holder changes institutions or leaves the Requestor for any reason during the particular Library Card access period, then the Requestor will deactivate the Library Card Holders’ Library Card via the DUOS Signing Official interface and ensure that the Requestor Investigator completes the Project Close-Out process before leaving the Requestor. Before the Data covered by such Requestor Investigator’s Library Card may be re-accessed, a new DAR with the Institutional Signing Official of the new institution’s approval (either via submitting such DAR through DUOS or by such new institution agreeing to its own Library Card Agreement and issuing a Library Card thereunder to such Requestor Investigator) must be approved by the applicable DAC.


4. ***Requestor Responsibilities***. The Requestor acknowledges and agrees that, by issuing Library Cards to Requestor Investigators, the Requestor is pre-authorizing such Requestor Investigators to submit DARs directly to one or more DACs managing Data using DUOS, without further Requestor review. By issuing a Library Card to a Requestor Investigator, the Requestor certifies to Broad that the Requestor Investigator is in good standing (e.g., no known sanctions) with the Requestor, relevant funding agencies and relevant regulatory agencies and is eligible to conduct independent research. The Requestor is responsible for ensuring its Library Card Holders submit a Project Renewal or Project Close-Out prior to the expiration date of the one (1) year data access period. 


5. ***Use of Data***. The Requestor agrees that Data will only be used for the Project (described in the applicable DAR), only by Authorized Users, and only after such Authorized Users have been informed of and agreed to the provisions and restrictions stated in this Agreement. The Requestor is responsible for ensuring that each Authorized User’s access and use of the Data is in accordance with (a) the parameters of the applicable internal research use, as well as any limitations on such use, as described in the DAR and DUOS, (b) all applicable national, tribal, state and other laws, rules and regulations, (c) all professional standards applicable to the use, confidentiality, security and disclosure of such Data, and (c) all applicable institutional policies and procedures for managing sensitive genomic data. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing provisions of this Section 5, the Requestor agrees that the Data will not be sold or offered as the basis for or in conjunction with any service. 


6. ***No Third Party Data Sharing***. The Requestor and its Authorized Users will not share Data with any third parties. Any collaborator involved in a Project who works for an institution other than the Requestor must be granted access by the applicable DAC pursuant to an independent DAR submitted to such DAC as described in Section 3 above. 


7. ***Confidentiality***. The Requestor agrees that it and all Authorized Users will preserve at all times the confidentiality of the Data and, without limitation, will not use or attempt to use the Data to contact or identify any Research Participant. The Requestor confirms that all Authorized Users receiving access to the Data will have completed all required training (whether on-line or classroom-based) on appropriate handling and protection of human subjects data.


8. ***Data Security***. The Requestor represents and warrants that it has enacted appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to prevent unauthorized use of or access to the Data and will comply with any specific terms included in the data use limitations for specific Data provided by Broad and/or the Data Provider relating to safeguarding of such Data. 


9. ***DUOS***. Broad hereby represents and warrants to the Requestor that:\
\
9.1 the Data’s *data use restrictions* have been coded in DUOS in accordance with the instructions of the applicable Data Provider;\
\
9.2 each Data Provider has represented to Broad that its Data’s data use restrictions as coded in DUOS are consistent with the applicable law and applicable consents under which such Data was collected; and\
