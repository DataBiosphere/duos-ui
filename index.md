## How To: Register your data in DUOS





### Researchers are often motivated or required to share their data.

### DUOS enables researchers to register their dataset with a DUOS ID so it can be requested for secondary research use. 

To register your data’s info in DUOS, you must first have your data available in a location where other researchers can access it, such as Broad’s .[Terra](https://app.terra.bio) system. 

Note, DUOS does not store genomic data.

Once you’ve confirmed your data will be in an accessible location, you must have an organizational sign-off from your institution’s Signing Official on the DUOS Data Provider Agreement (download here), acknowledging you as an Authorized Submission Representative to register your dataset in DUOS.

You will then be allowed to complete a DUOS Dataset Registration form. In doing so, you will need to select a data access committee (DAC) which will be responsible for reviewing and deciding on access requests for your data. You must either be the Chair of the DAC or have written agreement from the DAC before they are able to assume management of your dataset. 

Once the form is completed and the DAC confirms their willingness to manage access requests for the data, your data will be made available in the DUOS Dataset Catalog with a unique DUOS ID that serves as an accession identifier and can be shared with publishers and requestors.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/DataBiosphere/duos-ui/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
